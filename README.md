# Spitfire
Initial foray into using GitHub
Lesson One: RTFM.  Sooo, I sorta did that but not really which is why this repository is called Spitfire instead of Hello-World.

Personally, I like Spitfire better, because it's one of the kitten's name. Probablu should be HellsFire. She's quite the handful for weighing in at 5 oz.
